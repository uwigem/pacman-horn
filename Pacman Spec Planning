Pacman Specification Planning

Basic functions of:
Pacman
	Movement (up, down, left, right)
		Update future position (assuming some sort of update/tick in the main file)
	/** Takes in images of Pacman */
 	public void setImage(PImage img);

	/** Returns the current position of Pacman */
	@return the position of Pacman
	public int currentPosition();
	
	
	Eating dots
		Dot goes away
		Score added
	/** Updtes score and removes dots as Pacman eats them*/	
	public void eatDots();
	
	Eating fruit
		Fruit goes away
		Score gets added
		Ghosts turn blue
		Pacman gains powerup
		Powerup timer starts
	/** Updates score, removes fruit from map, changes state of pacman, returns a powerup timer* 
	public long eatFruit();

	/** Changes state of pacman by alterning its color */
	@param image of Pacman in powerup state
	@param indication of what fruit pacman ate
	public void powerupPac(PImage img, int fruit);

	Collision with wall (Or should Wall keep track of this?)
		Pacman stops
	
	Collision with ghost (Or should ghost keep track of this?)
		Normal collision
			Pacman dies
		Pacman with powerup
			Ghost dies
			Score gets added

Wall
	Maybe collision with pacman/ghost?

Ghost
	Whether Pacman has powerup
		Ghost turns blue
		Ghost runs away from Pacman
	Running towards Pacman (normal behavior)
	Running away from Pacman (when powerup active)

* Need to make Java files with interfaces for Pacman, Ghost, and Wall
* Java files need Javadoc style for comments
* Java files need descriptions of methods, snippets of example code
* Do we need a file for the graphics? Not sure how that works
