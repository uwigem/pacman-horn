		Pacman stops
	Collision with ghost (Or should ghost keep track of this?)
		Normal collision
			Pacman dies
		Pacman with powerup

	Maybe collision with pacman/ghost?

Ghost
	Whether Pacman has powerup
		Ghost turns blue
		Ghost runs away from Pacman
	Running towards Pacman (normal behavior)
	Running away from Pacman (when powerup active)

* Need to make Java files with interfaces for Pacman, Ghost, and Wall
* Java files need Javadoc style for comments
* Java files need descriptions of methods, snippets of example code
* Do we need a file for the graphics? Not sure how that works
